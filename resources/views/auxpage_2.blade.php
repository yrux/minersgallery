            Each item has it own <b>Handling</b> costs based upon the
            packaging required for safe shipping. https://postcalc.usps.com/
        </p>
        <p>
            Each Order's shipping is based upon <b>total weight</b>, the
            <b>destination zone</b> and the shipping organizations shipping
            <b>costs tables</b>. We use USPS almost exclusively.

        <p>
            The US Postal Service give us the figures for shipping charges but
            we have noticed that they have two charges, one for on-line and
            one for in-store.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ship from the Post Office and thus have access to other
            services also like the <b>Priority Flat Rate Box</b> that is not
            available from their online shipping calculator. These shipping
            costs are significantly less. You can find them at&nbsp;<a
