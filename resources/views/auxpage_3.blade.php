        <p>
            We find most of our Southern California specimens or we know the
            mine owners. All Holbrook, Arizona petrified wood was collected by
            us on private property. We have bought collections and found good
            deals in Quartzite Arizona. Traveled to Columbia and bought
            Emeralds. Dug in old potential copper mines and took out great
            solid Chrysocolla or is it Turquoise with some looking like gem
            silica.
        </p>
        <p>
            We own two Pegmatite load mines that are more of a prospect now
            then true mines. "The Donna Mine" and "Lost Peg Mine" are located
            near Warner Springs Calif. on Lost Valley Road. In the Summer
            months, we will be river dredging for Gold for a week at a time.
            Dry washing time is over as it is starting to get hot in the
            Desert. Please call us or e-mail us if you have any questions.
            <br />Thanks
